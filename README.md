OpenX — Unlimited AI. No login. No limits.
A fully free, unlimited AI chat platform. No login, no signup, instant access. Powered by the ShivanshAI-1.1 model with streaming responses, Markdown rendering, a reasoning ("Thinking") panel, real-time web search, dark/light mode, and local-only chat history.

Made by Shivansh Rai.

🔐 How your API key stays private (important)
OpenX uses a server-side secret key that is never pushed to GitHub:

Where	Is the key visible?
GitHub repo (code)	❌ No key anywhere
.env (your machine)	✅ gitignored — never committed
.env.example (in repo)	❌ Placeholder only (your-key-here)
Vercel Environment Variables	✅ Secret — only the server can read it
Website visitors / browser	❌ Never see it, never see "NVIDIA"
The model shown to users is always ShivanshAI-1.1. The real backend engine and its provider are abstracted away on the server — visitors only ever see the ShivanshAI brand.

You cannot bake a key into the code and also hide it from people who download the code. The secure way is exactly what this repo does: the key lives in a gitignored .env locally and a secret Environment Variable on Vercel. Everyone who visits your deployed site gets working AI powered by your key — but nobody can steal it.

💻 Run locally
Prerequisites: Node.js 18+ (from nodejs.org).

# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Create your private env file from the example
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Open .env and paste your key on the SHIVANSHAI_API_KEY line, e.g.
#    SHIVANSHAI_API_KEY="nvapi-xxxxxxxx"
#    SHIVANSHAI_API_URL="https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1"

# 4. Start the dev server
npm run dev
Open 👉 http://localhost:3000

Your .env file is ignored by Git, so the key inside it is never uploaded.

🐙 Push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: OpenX"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/openx.git
git push -u origin main
Verify the key is safe before pushing — .env should NOT appear:

git status            # .env must be absent from tracked files
cat .gitignore        # confirms .env is ignored
If .env ever shows up as a tracked file, do not push. Re-check .gitignore. (If it was already pushed by mistake, rotate/regenerate your API key immediately.)

▲ Deploy to Vercel (free)
Go to vercel.com → sign in with GitHub.
Add New… → Project → import your openx repo.
Vercel auto-detects Next.js. Under "Environment Variables", add:
Name: SHIVANSHAI_API_KEY · Value: your key · ✅ keep secret
Name: SHIVANSHAI_API_URL · Value: https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1
Click Deploy. Done! 🎉
Your site is now live. Every visitor chats with ShivanshAI-1.1, powered by your private key — and nobody can see it.

Optional: connect to a database
Not required. OpenX stores all chat history in the browser (localStorage). The /api/health check works with or without a database. If you want the DB health check on Vercel, add a DATABASE_URL env var (e.g. from Neon/Supabase).
